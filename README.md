# The project
This project is part of a bootcamp by FactoriaF5 where the main goal is to aquire the ability to create a fully functional database which can be accessed by MVC (Model View Controller) method using PHP (Laravel) and make a fully functional webpage with user and admin roles, where the admin can CRUD (create, read, update and delete) the products (tech events) and the user can sign up to them.

## Future versions
For next versions our team wants to add a the superadmin role that can choose who is admin, whe also want to givem more power to the admin so he can ban users from the platform and delete many events at the same time.
We also would like to test better our code and implement some quality of life improvements for the user.
