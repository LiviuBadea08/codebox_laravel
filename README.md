```
Install all the dependencies using composer

You can now access the server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
## Database seeding
Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.
Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement
```bash
database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php
```
Run the database seeder and you're done
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
Note : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command
```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
```
